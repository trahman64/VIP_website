## The VIP Model

The Vertically Integrated Projects (VIP) Program is a nonprofit alliance of colleges and universities that engages students in long-term, large-scale, faculty-led research. 




## The VIP Consortium

Currently, VIP includes 50+ universities across 13 countries, each adapting the model in its own way to fit their institutional culture. Students from all backgrounds from STEM to Humanities are encouraged to participate. Look at the [Vertically Integrated Projects Consortium] (https://www.vip-consortium.org/) for more information.

## VIP at MSU

At MSU, VIP program started in the spring semester of 2026 through the efforts of Dirk Colbry.

# Vertically Integrated Projects

The Vertically Integrated Projects at Michigan State University connects undergraduate students from all disciplines to long-term research led by faculty and graduate students.Students can earn academic credit simultaneously in MSU's VIP program. Faculty and graduate mentors can gain valuable support and insights by letting students take variety of roles across multidisciplinary teams.


This is an unconventional course where students gain hands-on experience in collaborative, faculty driven projects from diverse backgrounds. These projects can last three semester which will be a total of 6 credits. Faculty members leading projects are departments of Computational Mathematics, Science and Engineering (CMSE), Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE).

Students interested in VIP are encouraged to look at the faculty and the syllabus to see if they are interested.
